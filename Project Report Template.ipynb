    "The model that we used was an initial single linear regression model, several multiple linear regression models, and finally a lasso regression model. We decided to optimize for the performance metric of RMSE. We did this because we wanted to penalize large errors, since large errors could mean that the customer ends up paying a much higher price than they were expecting if using our model to try and predict the ride price (which could be an undue, large financial strain for them). Therefore, since RMSE properly penalizes these large errors versus other options like MAE (which equally penalizes the error from each observation), we will proceed with utilizing this performance metric to optimize. \n",
    "\n",
    "There was nothing too unorthodox or new in our approach. We decided to start with a base/naive model with what we thought would be the singlemost important predictor (distance), and then we moved onto using all of the predictors in the dataset and the new predictor variables that we created to get new multiple linear regression models. Lastly, we used a lasso regression model considering all of the previously used predictor variables and all possible two-factor interactions as predictors. We decided to use a lasso regression model because doing so could be used for variable selection and could handle the presence of stronger correlated features that existed in the dataset. XXXXXXX *better reason for lasso* XXXXXXX. \n",
    "\n",
    "We anticipated problems when it came to preparing the actual data that allowed us to go about our approach. Specifically, there was only select weather data available for various source and destination locations on specific dates and at specific times. As such, we did in fact encounter this problem when approaching how to best clean and prepare the data itself before going about developing our models. Additionally, we anticipated the problem of multicollinearity when it came to the dummy variables we were going to create on the type of ride and with weather variables. XXXXXX (did we encounter this problem) XXXXXX. Lastly, we wanted to potentially focus on autocorrelation as a possible problem we anticipated and wanted to explore in our data further. The first model that we tried including our created variables and the weather variables only had a slight improvement compared with the base/naive model of all the ride dataset variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our problem did already have some solutions posted on Kaggle trying to predict the ride price of Uber/Lyft rides in the same datasets. The one solution of these that we did look at closer decided to approach the problem we encountered with data cleaning/preparation of the weather variables by averaging them out for each source and destination location. After further analysis, we decided that this wouldn't be the best approach, since the average rainfall, cloud coverage, etc. of a given location isn't what we wanted to examine as predictors. Instead, we wanted accurate weather information of an actual given time for a location, which is why we took the steps we did to clean the data and get only the observations that had said weather data for locations at specific times. Further, this solution did not handle the potential issues with multicollinearity or exploration of autocorrelation, which we decided to analyze to build upon this solution. While this model only ended up analyzing R-squared as a performance metric, we do believe that our model was better compared to this solution. Although we cannot compare by RMSE, the solution's model does little to build upon the multiple linear regression model RMSE with all the train and weather predictor variables, and as such, we believe that our lasso regression model does in fact do better when compared to this solution. Additionally, since this solution's model does not handle the possibility of multicollinearity, we believe that our final model is better since we have confirmed that no problematic amounts of multicollinearity exist.

    "The base model was created as a single linear regression model using distance as the only predictor variable and price as the response variable. The resulting RMSE for test data of the model was approximately 9.16 USD. The mean for the price of the cleaned data observations was approximately 16.82 USD and the standard error was approximately 9.86 USD. We decided to make a better base model as a multiple linear regression model using all of the variables from the ride dataset as predictor variables (including distance, source, destination, name, product_id, and cab_type but not surge_multiplier, since this would not be known by the stakeholders at the time of the prediction). We made this decision because we felt that it would be a better representation of comparison for our efforts in improving the base model. The resulting RMSE for test data of the better initial model was approximately 3.63 USD. \n",
    "\n",
    "From this, we examined the predictor variables for potential variable transformations that would be helpful in improving model performance as measured by RMSE for test data. Ultimately, we discovered one possible non-linear relationship between distance and price from a barplot of price against binned distance (with the price increasing slightly more as binned distance increased) that was shown in our code report. As such, we decided it would be prudent to examine whether a log(distance) transformation would improve RMSE if included in a model (which it ended up doing) because of the possible non-linear relationship between price and distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we decided to examine whether this base multiple linear regression model also violated any modeling assumptions. Specifically, we did so by plotting residuals against fitted values. While this base model did mostly seem to not violate the linearity assumption, there did seem to be a problematic trend as the fitted values increased that residuals tended to stray away from the line of residuals = 0 that could mean it violated the constant variance assumption. As such, we then thought that it would be a good next step to use log(price) as our response variable in the next model we developed. Since this log transformation of price will result in a higher shrinkage of larger values, to some extent we were hoping that this would resolve this issue. \n",

    "We then went about approaching 2-factor interactions and variable selection by creating a lasso regression model.

From our calculations, we found that the RSE was XXXXXXXXX RSE VALUE XXXXXXXXX. Compared with the RMSE value for the model for test data of XXXXXXXXX RMSE VALUE XXXXXXXXXX, the RSE was comparable with that of the RMSE. As such, it means that we can conclude from interpreting these results that the lasso regression model was not overfitting. Should the model return a far lower RSE for the train data than the RMSE for test data, this means that the model parameters were only optimized for traiing data and thus overfit. However, this was not the case because the two values were comparable, as explored in the calculations previously mentioned. \n",

    "For the inference portion of our project, the inference technically holds for Boston rides, since the dataset only contains Boston rides data observations. However, should our stakeholders want to abstract our analysis on which predictor variables are relatively the most important predictors for ride price, we would need to redevelop our models with data from other cities with the same methods we used. However, to a large extent, the general trends will remain true regardless of the city, such that the overall importance of predictors for ride price can remain more or less useful in other major cities like Boston. Additionally, because this data was from 2018, the importance of predictors might be slightly outdated. However, from research knowing that distance and demand for rides impact the pricing algorithms on Uber/Lyft rides, we still see that this same relative importance of predictors will likely remain similar for rides today. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the prediction portion of our project, the stakeholder will be able to predict the outcome approximately one week out before the outcome occurs up until the actual ride takes place. Since we are using the type of ride, whether the ride was Uber/Lyft, and various weather variables to predict the price of a ride, this information will all become fairly accurate and available a week before one will take the ride (assuming that they have access to weather data through applications/websites that are usually accurate a week prior). If they have the information available about when they are preparing to take the ride and what type of ride they will take, then Uber and Lyft users are able to use our final model to predict what the price of their ride will likely be. Additionally, the same applies for Uber/Lyft drivers and taxi companies and drivers on predicting the likely price of Uber/Lyft rides with the given data. Further, we noted previously that since the data is for Boston rides only, the analysis may only be applicable for Boston (while possibly for other major cities), and the model can be redeveloped with new data for other cities, as well. It is also important to note that due to using a smaller weather dataset than rides dataset, when combined, we lost many data points. Our final data set had very limited data points for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Thus, our model may be less accurate for predicting prices on the weekends when demand could be different. However, if more data is collected and the same process of model creation is followed, predictions will become more accurate in the case that our limited weekend data is not representative of all rides on weekends. \n",

    "The model will likely become too obsolete to be useful for prediction in coming years as Uber/Lyft change their pricing algorithm. However, approaching the development of models in a similar way to how we did with the new data can be done to make it more relevant. However, although the relative importance may shift slightly compared to other predictors, largely the inference part of our project won't become too obsolete for quite some years, given that, for instance, distance and the type of ride will remain largely important in Uber/Lyft's pricing algorithms.

    "Based on our model, distance and product type are the most important factors that determine the price of a ride, while time of day and source/destination had little impact. Additionally, our model can accurately predict the price of a ride in Boston with an RMSE of $2.22. We recommned that Uber and Lyft riders should walk (if possible) to decrease ride distances and check both Uber and Lyft ride offerings to maximize savings. These would be more impactful than trying to plan a schedule of taking rides at certain times from certain places as those minimally impact ride price. For rideshare drivers, we recommend that they become drivers for both Uber and Lyft, so they can compare the prices of each at different times to maximize revenue. Finally, we recommend Taxi drivers who want to make competitive pricing can use our model to accurately predict the competition ride price to price lower and attract more customers with their better rates. This would be specifically useful to adjust their rates based on distance, as they could see how their prices for a ride of a certain distance compare to that of rideshare companies. One limitation of the model is that our data only considers rides in Boston for a 3 week period. Ride prices could fluctuate marginally in different places during different times of the year, resulting in a potential increase in the RMSE of our model. However, we can reasonably anticipate the general trends of our model to stay consistent regardless of urban area or time of year. This model would benefit from being updated yearly to account for inflation, however. A second limitation of the model is that it wasn't able to quite capture trends in demand for rides using weather, location, and time of day. From our personal experience, we know that demand surges can be hyper-localized: rideshare prices around a stadium/arena after a concert or sporting event tend to skyrocket for example. Surges like these are difficult to predict with a model as they require ultra-specific data about different locations at different times. It would be beneficial to the stakeholders if a model to predict this demand could be developed, but for now riders, drivers, and Taxi should be aware of events near their area and use their intuition regarding influences of demand. \n"

We think that GitHub did make it easier in having a centralized place to do all of our collaboration; however, we felt that it was tedious to remind each other when we were committing to avoid overwriting other contributions from commits and pushes.
