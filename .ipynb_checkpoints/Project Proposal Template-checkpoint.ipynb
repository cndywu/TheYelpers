    "2. This will be a regression problem, in which we predict the price of the cab ride based on various ride factors. Because the price of the cab ride is a continuous variable, this is a regression problem. \n",
    "3. This will primarily be a prediction problem, since we are trying to predict a value that we don’t know yet (price of a cab given certain input factors). However, we may also be interested in seeing the associations of predictor variables with the price, so we may also approach it as an inference problem in this case. \n",
    "4. For assessing model accuracy, we will try to optimize RMSE because we want to penalize large errors, since large errors could mean that the customer ends up paying a much higher price than they were expecting, and that could be a large financial strain for them. \n",
    "5. Because there are a large number of predictors/variables being used (some of which are likely to correlated or collinear, like distance and time_stamp[when ride occurred]), we will likely have to do variable selection using techniques learned later in the course. Because it is possible that the predictors and the response will not have a linear relationship, we can use what we learned with variable transformation (quadratic or cubic) to obtain a better fit. Further, we can consider variable interactions between continuous predictors, include qualitative predictors in the model, or include qualitative predictors and their interactions with continuous predictors to include associations between qualitative predictors and the response variable, in addition to relaxing assumptions that the association between a predictor and the response variable doesn’t depend on the values of other predictors.

    "We expect to find distance to be the best estimator of ride price, and weather and time of day could be helpful estimators as well. Distance will likely have a strong, positive, linear relationship with price, while weather and time of day will need to be split into dummies corresponding to different times of the day and weather conditions. Prices will likely spike during work rush times and be more relaxed during more dormant times, and on the weather side prices will likely spike during harsh weather conditions such as rain/snow/extreme cold. In terms of accuracy, we are predicting rideshare prices, which have a typical range of about 10USD - 100USD and probably an average of around 30USD - 50USD (we will develop more accurate estimates for these numbers with our data). In order for our model to be helpful to the stakeholders (mainly rideshare users), a sensible RMSE would definitely be less than the mean rideshare price, and ideally less than half the mean as well; a good target number would be maybe around 15USD. However, it would be interesting to explore the residuals as percents as being off by 15USD is a lot more significant to someone who is paying 10USD for a ride versus someone who is paying 60USD for a ride. Overall, we will ensure that our RMSE is much better than that of a trivial model with only the intercept term. "
